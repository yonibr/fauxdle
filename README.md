# Fauxdle
Worldle after plastic surgery

## Requirements
- python >= 3.10
- packages:
  - pandas (what can I say, I'm a data scientist)
  - english-words
  

## Installation:
Note: if you know what a virtual environment is, feel free to use one. This is meant for less technical people

1. Download and unzip this repository and note the location of the folder
2. Install python 3.10 (or later) if not installed. If present, make sure you select the check box that says something like "Add python to path"
3. Open a command prompt
   - On Windows, open the start menu and type "cmd" and press enter once Command Prompt is selected
   - On macOS, press âŒ˜ and *space* and type "terminal" and press enter once Terminal.app is selected
   - If you're on linux, I don't think you need help with this
4. Type (into the command prompt) *pip install pandas english-words* then press enter
5. Change directory to where you saved the repository by typing *cd path/to/fauxdle* where you replace the path with the correct one (e.g. *cd Downloads/fauxdle*)
6. Launch the file by typing into the command prompt *python main.py*
   - If you're on macOS, you might need to type *python3.10 main.py* instead
   - If you're on Windows and this didn't work, try reinstalling python and make sure you select the option to add python to path.
  
## TODOs
- Use a better English dictionary
- create clickable scripts to set up and run Fauxdle so using the command prompt isn't needed
